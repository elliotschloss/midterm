<h1>The Politics</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph about the political system today. As you can see by the photo, the political section of this paper is going through a rough time, too mainy sad or depressing stories. </script>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="571" data-total-count="571">Since the beginning of this administration that a few trustworthy people in the White House were checking Donald Trump’s worst instincts. A collection of generals, New York finance types and institution-minded Republicans were said to be nobly sacrificing their reputations and serving a disgraceful president for the good of the country. Through strategic leaks they presented themselves as guardians of American democracy rather than collaborators in its undoing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="694" data-total-count="1265">The success of this informal alliance is hard to gauge. Last August, after the president said there were “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/read-the-transcript-of-donald-trumps-jaw-dropping-press-conference.html">very fine people</a>” among the white supremacist marchers in Charlottesville, Va., senior officials <a href="https://www.axios.com/why-top-white-house-officials-wont-quit-trump-1513304961-5bb42132-fac3-4224-8d30-2760efba7fe9.html">rationalized their continued role in the administration</a> to Mike Allen of Axios. “If they weren’t there, they say, we would have a trade war with China, massive deportations, and a government shutdown to force construction of a Southern wall,” Allen wrote. Since then, we’ve had a government shutdown over immigration, albeit a brief one. A trade war appears imminent. Arrests of undocumented immigrants — particularly those without criminal records — have continued to surge.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="1555">Over the past 14 months we’ve also seen monstrous levels of corruption and chaos, a plummeting of America’s standing in the world and the obliteration of a host of democratic norms. Yet things could always be worse; the economy is doing well and Trump has not yet started any real wars.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="785" data-total-count="2340">Increasingly, however, the people who were supposed to be the adults in the room aren’t in the room anymore. The former Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell left in January. Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council, announced his resignation on March 6. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was terminated by tweet on Tuesday. National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster will <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/trump-is-going-for-a-clean-reset">reportedly be among the next to go</a>, and Trump may soon fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, possibly as a prelude to shutting down the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Adding to the tumult, a parade of lesser officials have either quit or been fired, including the White House communications director Hope Hicks, staff secretary Rob Porter and Trump’s personal aide John McEntee.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="752" data-total-count="3092" id="story-continues-1">The self-styled grown-ups are, for the most part, being replaced by lackeys and ideologues. Larry Kudlow, the CNBC pundit Trump has appointed to succeed Cohn, is known for the <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/new-trump-economist-kudlow-has-been-wrong-about-everything.html">consistent wrongness of his predictions</a>. Tillerson was a terrible secretary of state, but unlike his chosen successor, the director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, he never trafficked in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pompeo-benghazi_us_5aa7e17ee4b03c9edfaffc07">nut-job Benghazi conspiracy theories</a> or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/pompeo-trump-tillerson/547217/">anti-Muslim invective</a>. John Roberts of Fox News reported that McMaster could be <a href="https://twitter.com/johnrobertsFox/status/974048887399952384">replaced by uberhawk John Bolton</a>, who last month wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374">The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First</a>.” (Bolton has described proposed talks between Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea as an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/03/09/diplomatic-shock-and-awe-heres-how-people-are-reacting-to-trumps-move-to-meet-kim-jong-un/?utm_term=.2790a8663f70">opportunity to deliver a harsh ultimatum</a>.)</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

That would partly vindicate the adults’ claims that things would be even messier without them. But it would also mean that by protecting the country from the consequences of an unhinged president, they helped Trump consolidate his power while he learned how to transcend restraints.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="3675">Whatever their accomplishments, if from their privileged perches these people saw the president as a dangerous fool in need of babysitting, it’s now time for some of them to say so publicly.</p><div class="newsletter-signup variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="TY" data-newsletter-productTitle="Opinion Today" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">
